To install the library you need to do the
following:

1. Set the CXXFLAGS environment variable to
your preferred settings, for example:
  export CXXFLAGS="-O2"
  export CXXFLAGS="-Wall -g"
The default flags are "-g -O2" or "-g", depending
on your system.

2. Run:
  ./configure
By default include files and library files
will be installed in /usr/local. If you would
like to use a different installation directory
(e.g., in case that you do not have root access)
run the configure script with the --prefix option:
  ./configure --prefix=/home/marioh/usr

3. Make the library:
  make

4. Install the library:
  make install

You are ready to use the library. All you have to
do is to include the file Tools.h in your source
files and then compile with the following options:
  g++ MyFile.cc -o MyFile -L/home/marioh/usr/lib -I/home/marioh/usr/include -lpthread -ltools

If the library is installed in the default /usr/local
path, then the -I and -L options are not necessary.

If you are compiling on Mac OS X you will probably
have to add the -bind_at_load option when linking.
