The purpose of this directory is to provide python support for P2.
All python extension modules can be found under the 'python/p2' 
directory. Please refer to the README in that directory for further
information. 

The next generation dataflow language is located in
'python/dfparser'. At this time there is no documentation for the
dataflow langauge. The interested party should post question to
the p2devel@yahoogroups.com list regarding any early assistance
with the dataflow language. The dataflow language does have limited
operation, and examples can be found in the 'python/scripts' directory.
