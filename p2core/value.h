 * DESCRIPTION: P2's concrete type system.  The base type for values.
 * So you want to add a new P2 concrete type... Please follow these steps.
 * 1. Define new class Val_NAME in files val_NAME.h and val_NAME.C substituting 
 *    NAME for the name of your new type.
 * 2. The new class must inherit from class Value and override necessary virtual
 *    methods. 
 * 3. Define a new TypeCode right before the TYPES definition.
 * 4. In the class definition create the following public static member 
 *    variable definition: 
 *        const static Oper *oper_;
 * 5. We must now initialize the oper_ member variable in the Val_NAME.C file.
 *    Here is how the initialization should look:
 *        const Oper* Val_NAME::oper_ = New Oper##();
 *    What goes in place of ## depends on the way in which you'd like to 
 *    define your operator function for your new type. There are a few ways we 
 *    can do this, which I've listed below. 
 *    1. The easiest way is to use OperImpl<Val_NAME>() template class, which
 *       defines the most basic operator functions. If you fit this category
 *       then this step is done. See type Val_Int32 for an example of this case.
 *    2. If your new type does not really fit the basic operator function templete
 *       you'll need to define your own subclass of Oper. There are a couple of 
 *       ways to do this.
 *       1. Lets say that your new type needs special attention for the math or bit 
 *          operator functions only and the basic comparison function will do just fine.
 *          Then your class can simply inherit from class OperCompare<Val_NAME> and
 *          all the basic comparison functions are given to you for free. You are then
 *          responsible for defining the missing math and bit operator functions in your
 *          OperNAME subclass. See Val_Str type for an example of this case.
 *       2. If for some reason your new type require special attention in the comparison
 *          operator functions then you'll need to inherit directly from class Oper. This
 *          will require you to define those operator functions that you wish to support.
 *          No known examples of this case since you should be overriding Value::compareTo 
 *          method!
 *       NOTE:
 *          Any operator function that is not defined in some subclass of Oper
 *          will cause an Oper::Exception to be thrown when that operator is applied 
 *          to your types and your type is the base type of the operands. 
 * 6. Register the operator function of our new type. To do this go to oper.C and follow 
 *    the instructions for filling in the operator table (oper_table_). You'll be filling
 *    the table with the Val_NAME::oper_ static member variable that we created and 
 *    initialized in the previous step... Depending on the base type you may be using
 *    other type's oper_ variable.
 * 7. Compile and done.
