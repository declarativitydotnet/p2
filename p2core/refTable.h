 * DESCRIPTION: Counting version of the P2 table class.  Its differences
 * from the Table2 class are the following
 *
 * * Tuples do not expire, either due to maximum table size or due to
 *   maximum tuple lifetime.
 *
 * * Reinsertions of a tuple into the table cause a counter associated
 *   with that tuple to be incremented.  Removals of a tuple from the
 *   table cause that counter to be decremented. A tuple is only removed
 *   when its counter reaches 0.
 *
 * * Update and removed events are only issued when a tuple is first
 *   inserted into the table or removed from the table, not when only
 *   the counter changes.
 *
 * * No refresh events are issued ever.
 *
 * * There is no flushing queue, since there are no expirations.
 *

      key. If it's equal (as per compareTo), increment the counter but
      otherwise do nothing (i.e., update no aggregates or listeners, and
