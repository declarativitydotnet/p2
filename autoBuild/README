NAME
----

    autoBuild.py -- functionality to build a specific revision of a
branch in P2 and run regression tests with that build. Also provides the
option to run regression tests with a local build.


SYNOPSIS
--------

python autoBuild.py  [-C config file directory path | -F config file path]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

autoBuild.py provides two functionalities:

1. checkout a specific revision or latest revision (default) of a branch
from the svn repository and build

2. Run regression tests with the build from step 1 or a local build

autoBuild.py requires a configuration file to set parameters that are
used for building P2 and running regression tests.

The options are:

-F Specify the path of a specific configuration file

-C Specify the path of a directory that contains configuration
files. This allows multiple configurations file to be read. Builds with
respect to each configuration file is made and regression tests are run
with respect to each build.


CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

Configuration file contains a list of parameters that are used for
building P2 and running regression tests with respect to the build.

A configuration file has the following parameters:

branch-------Specify svn url of the P2 branch that has to be
             built. E.g. https://svn.declarativity.net/trunk

revision-----Specify which svn revision should be used. If no value is
             specified then the latest revision is checked out.

keep_build---Option to keep the build locally. Has no effect if
             run_build is No
                          Yes -  Keep the build locally
                          No  -  Do not keep the build locally

run_build----Option to use local build or not.
                          Yes - checkout a P2 branch and use the build
                                from this branch for running regression
                                tests
                          No -- Use local build for running regression
                                tests

verbose_result-Option to log the complete result with cmake, make and
               all regression tests output.
                          Yes - Log output of cmake, make and all
                                regression tests.
                          No -- Only failed regression tests output is
                                logged. Log output of cmake/make only if
                                they failed.

build_path-----Required if run_build is No. Give the path where the
               local build is residing.

unitTests_path-Required if run_build is No. Give the path where the
               regression tests are residing.

planner--------Planner to use for the regression
               tests. E.g. runStagedOverlog/runOverLog

to_address-----Email address if you want the results to be emailed to
               you. E.g. xyz@abc.com

from_address---Email address if you want the results to be emailed to
               you. E.g. xyz@abc.com

python_path----Python executable path

svn_path-------Svn executable path

sendmail_path--Sendmail executable path

cmake_path-----Cmake executable path

make_path------Make executable path

CMAKE Parameters: Default values are picked up if no value is
specified. Cmake parameters include CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, BISON_EXECUTABLE,
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR etc.

EXAMPLES
--------

Sample configuration files are present at
https://svn.declarativity.net/browser/trunk/autoBuild/configFiles

  1. autoBuild.conf checks out the latest revision of branch secure,
builds for the branch and runs regression tests with respect to the
build made
  2.  autoBuild_local.conf runs regression tests with a local build
