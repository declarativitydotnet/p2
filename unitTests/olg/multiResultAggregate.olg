  * DESCRIPTION: Event aggregates with group-by field from the joined
  * table.
  * 
  * Run me as follows:
  * tests/runOverLog -o unitTests/olg/multiResultAggregate.olg
  *
  * And error should be issued on the E field in matches for rule r1,
  * since we do not currently support group-by fields from tables within
  * an event-table aggregate.
