 * The lookup element for the new table structure.  It has a single
 * input where a lookup tuple arrives. The search of the table is
 * performed according to the index (if any) held for the table's
 * indexKey.  The lookup tuple is matched according to a 1-1 mapping
 * from its fields described by the lookupKey to the table's field
 * described by the index key (as per the definition of
 * Table2::lookup()).  On the output all matches for the lookup are
 * returned with successive pulls.  Outputs consist of tuples that
 * contain two embedded tuples, the first holding the lookup tuple and
 * the second holding the result if any.  The last output tuple to be
 * returned for a given search is empty (i.e., contains no fields).  If
 * a lookup yields no results, its only output tuple is the empty tuple.
 *
 * A lookup constructor may optionally take a state change callback,
 * which is called with true every time a lookup becomes busy (i.e.,
 * acquires a new probe tuple) and with false every time it becomes free
 * (i.e., it gives out its last result).
