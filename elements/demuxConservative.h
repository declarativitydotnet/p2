 * DESCRIPTION: A conservatively blocked demultiplexing element.  It
 * checks tuples' input field (the first by default) for equality with
 * the registered key for its outputs and routes tuples accordingly,
 * including the demux key.  It pushes back its input if any of its
 * outputs are backed up (the block-one-block-all policy).  If two or
 * more demux keys are equal, only the first receives a tuple; for
 * duplication an explicit duplicator element should be used.  The
 * element contains one extra output for the "else" case, i.e., for
 * input that matches no key.
