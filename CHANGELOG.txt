Release 0.7.4

- Broke out elements dependent on Python into pythonElements

- Reorganized automake files to remove deprecated variables such as
INCLUDES, to remove duplicate PYTHON macros, to remove any variable
definitions for user-specified variables (e.g., CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS),
to remove user-specifiable parameters (e.g., -Wall)

- Added support for .dylib libraries in acinclude.m4

- Added support for alternate OpenSSL locations in automake/autoconf

- Added an automake dependency on Automake version 1.9.2 and above.

- Replaced most direct uses of std::cout/cerr etc. for the TELL_*
macros, which allow overriding via the new Reporting static class.
Removed most functionality from LoggerI.  Reporting state is now set
directly via Reporting, not through the plumber, elements, etc.

- Reimplemented aggwrap (called Aggwrap2) to use modular aggregate
functions, to implement correctly empty-set aggregates, and to handle
group-by values and interspersed aggregate fields correctly. This will
soon replace the old Aggwrap in planner-generated dataflow graphs.

- Removed toDot specialization into the elements themselves to remove
cyclical dependence.

- Fixed bug in aggCount whereby _current was used uninitialized.

- Added AggFactory exception for not-found aggregates. Now the AggWrap
constructor and the aggregate function throw that exception, which is
properly caught.

- Now min/max aggregates return Val_Null on empty sets.

- Fixed table aggregates to deal correctly with empty-set groups.

- Added machinery into tables that flushes any empty-set aggregate
updates at the beginning of time (e.g., for any aggregate COUNT views
that should contain a correct tuple at the beginning).

- Added f_match in OverLog (from JMH).

- Removed many legacy tests/ programs.

- Added machinery for casting values in test scripts for tables and
aggregates (in unitTests)

- Added a tester for AggWrap2 in unitTests.
