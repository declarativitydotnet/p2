When you've checked out a fresh repository or modified the autoconf macros, first run setup to configure your new source tree:

   # ./setup

Then, to build the source, run configure and point it at your SFS
installation (e.g., /projects/phi/sfs).

   # configure --with-sfslib=/projects/phi/sfs/lib --with-sfsinc=/projects/phi/sfs/include
  
Then compile: 

   # make

Remember never to edit Makefile or Makefile.in.  Instead, make your
changes to Makefile.am.  If you're still having problems, ask the nice
folks on p2devel@yahoogroups.com.
