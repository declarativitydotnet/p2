When you've checked out a fresh repository or modified the autoconf
macros, first run setup to configure your new source tree:

   # ./setup
  
Then compile: 

   # make

Remember never to edit Makefile or Makefile.in.  Instead, make your
changes to Makefile.am.  If you're still having problems, ask the nice
folks on p2devel@yahoogroups.com.

NOTE ABOUT FLEX:

Make sure to have flex version 2.5.4 or greater installed before
building the project.

NOTE ABOUT AUTOMAKE:

If you want to run automake (i.e., if you want to run ./setup), make
sure you have automake version 1.9 or greater.
