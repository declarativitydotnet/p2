------------------------------------------------------------
-- BUILDING
------------------------------------------------------------

P2's makefiles are generated with cmake.  See README.cmake for more
information.

Once you're happy with the cmake configuration, run:

   # make

and if that goes well, install:

   # make install

If you install into /usr/local or another shared prefix, you may need
to run the "make install" command as root.

Remember never to edit Makefile.  Instead, edit CMakeCache.txt or use
ccmake.  If you're still having problems, ask the nice folks on
p2devel@yahoogroups.com.

NOTE ABOUT FLEX:

Make sure to have flex version 2.5.31 or greater installed before
building the project.  Fedora Core 7 and 8 come with version 2.5.33.
Users of earlier releases should install a newer flex package. For
instance, prebuilt binaries for 2.5.31-5 are available on the web.

NOTE ABOUT AUTOMAKE:

P2's automake files are deprecated, and have been replaced with cmake.

If you still want to run automake (i.e., if you want to run ./setup),
make sure you have automake version 1.9 or greater.  Automake builds
were last tested with libtool version 1.5.16.

NOTE ABOUT GCC:

Please use gcc version 4.0 and later to compile P2. Make sure that the
same major version is used to compile the boost binaries you are
using. When compiling on a current version of Fedora Core (e.g. FC5
through FC8) this is usually the case.

NOTE ABOUT BOOST:

Most of us develop against Boost version 1.33 or 1.34.  Support for
Boost 1.32 is deprecated.

It is difficult to get boost test to link in a portable fashion.  If
you receive a bus error when running p2Test, then try adding this to
CMakeCache.txt:

CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-DP2_LINK_WITH_BOOST_TEST

Alternatively, if p2Test says "Test setup error: test tree is empty",
then make sure that P2_LINK_WITH_BOOST_TEST is *not* defined.  If you
still can't get it to work, please send a message to
p2devel@yahoogroups.com with your operating system and boost versions.
Tell us where your copy of boost came from.  (Is it a precompiled
package?  Did you build it yourself?)

-- NOW WHAT?  TUTORIALS
------------------------------------------------------------

Please look at the UserGuide under doc/tutorial/UserGuide.pdf next. If
you can't find it there, then you can build it in the normal make
process, or by just doing

# pdflatex UserGuide.tex
